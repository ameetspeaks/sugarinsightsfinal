# Onboarding Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Issues
**Problem**: The database schema was incompatible with Supabase's built-in auth system
- Tables were referencing a custom `users` table instead of Supabase's `auth.users`
- Missing `order_index` column in `onboarding_steps` table
- Foreign key constraint violations
- Role relationship issues

**Solution**: 
- Created new migration file `database/migrations/002_fix_supabase_schema.sql`
- Updated schema to properly reference `auth.users(id)`
- Fixed table structure to work with Supabase's auth system
- Added proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies

### 2. SupabaseAuthService Issues
**Problem**: Service methods were trying to access non-existent columns and relationships
- `_loadUserProfile` was trying to join with `roles` table
- `updateOnboardingProgress` was using `step_id` instead of `step_name`
- `getOnboardingSteps` was using incorrect column names
- `checkEmailExists` was trying to query `auth.users` directly

**Solution**:
- Fixed `_loadUserProfile` to work without role relationships
- Updated `updateOnboardingProgress` to use `step_name` parameter
- Rewrote `getOnboardingSteps` to properly combine steps with progress
- Fixed `checkEmailExists` to work with Supabase auth limitations
- Updated `_checkOnboardingStatus` to properly check completion

### 3. Onboarding Screen Issues
**Problem**: Onboarding screens were not saving progress to the database
- All screens were just navigating without saving data
- No progress tracking was happening
- Onboarding completion was not being recorded

**Solution**:
- Updated all onboarding screens to save progress using `updateOnboardingProgress`
- Added proper error handling for database operations
- Fixed the final screen to complete onboarding properly

## Files Modified

- `lib/screens/onboarding/height_weight_screen.dart` - Added progress saving
- `lib/screens/onboarding/diabetes_status_screen.dart` - Added progress saving

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database/run_migration.sql`
4. Execute the script
5. Verify that all tables are created successfully

### Step 2: Test the Fixes
1. Run the Flutter app
2. Try signing up with a new email
3. Complete the OTP verification
4. Verify that the onboarding flow starts properly
5. Complete each onboarding step and verify progress is saved
6. Verify that after completing all steps, you're redirected to the main screen

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Sign Up Flow**: 
   - User enters email and password
   - OTP is sent to email
   - After OTP verification, onboarding starts automatically

2. **Onboarding Flow**:
   - Each screen saves progress to database
   - Progress is tracked step by step
   - After completing all steps, user is redirected to main screen

3. **Database**:
   - All tables properly reference `auth.users`
   - Onboarding progress is saved correctly
   - No more foreign key constraint errors
   - Proper RLS policies ensure data security

## Error Messages Fixed

- ❌ `Could not find a relationship between 'user_profiles' and 'roles'`
- ❌ `Could not find the 'role_id' column of 'user_profiles'`
- ❌ `insert or update on table "user_profiles" violates foreign key constraint`
- ❌ `column onboarding_steps.order_index does not exist`
- ❌ `relation "public.auth.users" does not exist`

All these errors should be resolved after applying the fixes.
